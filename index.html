        <p>
          One of my favorite coding projects was "skilled picker". This is a website that you have the option to pick between what NBA players you get an autograph from. You have to stop the moving ticker using the spacebar to select your player. This project was fun to make and fun to play with.

    <div class="item">
        <h3>Hover Over Me<a href="./hover.html">→</a></h3>
       
        <p>
        "Hover Over Me" is a rather simple website that allows the text to be highlighted when you hover your mouse over it. It's simple but I like it because it looks complete.

    <div class="item">
        <h3>Wave Animation<a href="./220206b.html">→</a></h3>
        <p>
            The third website I'll be showing is a website that has a moving wave animation. This website was quite hard to make since I had to code the animation but it was worth it because the final product was good.

        <h3> Hi World<a href="./220109.html">→</a></h3>
        <p>
           The last project I'll be showing in my portfolio is my first ever coding project. This is just a simple website that contains my favorite photo and video of the time I made the website. It also contains my favorite website of the time: hacker keyboard.
