    <h1>Learn About Me</h1>
    <h2>Hi, I'm Justin Lee, just a 13 year old boy. I live in South Korea and I'm also Korean. I spent most of my life
        living in Korea although I did live in Singapore for 3 years. I am currently attending KIS, a school I love very
        much. Three words that describe me are athletic, funny, and friendly. I love playing sports, making jokes, and
        making new friends whenever I have the chance. I'm a huge dog person. Although I have many good human friends,
        my bestfriend is my dog, Cara. </h2>
    <h1>About Cara</h1>
    <h2>Cara is an one year and three month old pomeranian. Cara became a part of our family when she was two months
        old. I can't beleive how much she grew from the first time I laid eyes on her. Ever since she became an addition
        to our family, she never failed to make my family and I smile. Before I became a dog owner, I couldn't
        understand when people treated dogs as family. However, ever since I became a dog owner, I understood the
        feeling. Being a dog owner also made me feel like I was a big brother so it made me feel proud.</h2>
